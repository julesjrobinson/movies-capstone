# Pick-a-Flick

Here's my Capstone Project! - Pick-a-Flick (v1). I built an app that enables you to search and save your favorite movies. I chose this project because it's something that would be cool for me to use in my personal time. I used Ruby on Rails for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and an api from 'omdbapi.com' to render data for the films.
